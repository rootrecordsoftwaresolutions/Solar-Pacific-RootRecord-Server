"""Boot entry point for the `weather` skill's scheduler daemon.

Wires up the real deploy paths (per nextagent.md's stated code/data tree
split -- code under .ollama/skills/weather/, data under Database/) and
starts scheduler/run_cycle.py's run_forever() loop. This file is what
automations/scripts/ensure-weather-poller.sh launches in the background;
it is not meant to be imported.

Not run directly by automations/'s own job dispatcher (which runs each
job's command to completion, blocking, with a timeout) -- this process is
long-running by design, so it's started once as a detached background
daemon instead. See scripts/ensure-weather-poller.sh for the check-and
-start logic, matching the same pattern already used in this stack for
other persistent services (a-eyes cam server, council-relay, Ollama, FLM).
