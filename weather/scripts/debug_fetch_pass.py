"""One-off diagnostic -- NOT part of the deployed daemon, run by hand.

run_once()'s own log only prints on a whole-*module* exception; individual
resource failures inside fetch/_engine.py's run_resource() are caught
there and recorded on the Manifest (status + a counter), but the actual
reason (the exception string, or a validation/change-detection reason) is
carried on the in-memory FetchOutcome and normally just discarded once
run_cycle.py's dispatch loop moves on. This script calls every fetch
module directly, the same way run_once() does, and prints every single
outcome's resource_id / status / detail so a silent batch of failures
(wrong host, timeout, 403, validation failure, etc.) is visible in one
pass instead of needing per-resource instrumentation added and redeployed.

Safe to run any time: same fetch_all() calls run_once() already makes,
against the real base_dir, so it participates in the same manifest /
change-detection / archiving as a normal cycle -- it does not create a
second manifest or a parallel code path.
