"""The actual dispatch loop. Calls into fetch/, alerts/, and hurricanes/ on
their respective schedules -- makes no HTTP calls itself, per
scheduler/README.md's boundary rule.

Entry point: `run_forever(base_dir, hurricanes_base_dir)`. `run_once` does a
single dispatch pass and is what tests/ calls, since a real scheduler loop
isn't something a smoke test should sit through in real time.

ROBUSTNESS NOTE (added when this was wired up to run as an always-on
background daemon under automations/): every individual resource fetch
inside `fetch/_engine.py`'s `run_resource()` already catches its own
network/HTTP exceptions and records a "failed" outcome -- one bad resource
never takes down a fetch module. But nothing above that level was
similarly guarded: a whole module's `fetch_all()` raising (a config bug, a
JSON shape surprise, etc.), or `hurricanes.scripts.sources.poll()` (which
calls `http_client.get()` directly, with NO try/except of its own -- unlike
every `fetch/*.py` module), could previously propagate all the way out of
`run_once()` and kill the daemon outright, requiring a manual restart.
That was an acceptable gap for a smoke-tested/not-yet-networked build; it
is not acceptable for something meant to run unattended for weeks. Every
dispatch below is now wrapped so one module's exception is logged and
skipped, never fatal to the process.
